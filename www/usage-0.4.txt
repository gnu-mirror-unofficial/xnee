HI !

In order to release it ASAP I include this usage text file.

Basic stuff:
 to record:

  xnee_record -o xnee.log


 to replay 
 
  xnee_replay -file xnee.log



 to get hints on recording 
 
   xnee_record --help



Problem:

 Sometimes the first event recorded is a KeyRelease (from the Enter key when starting the program). 
 If you encounter problems when replaying, remove the first line in your log file ... hopefully it works:)
