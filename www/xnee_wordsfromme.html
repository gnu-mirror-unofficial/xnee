<h2>Some words from me</h2>
Some years ago, I made a master thesis with a friend of mine, Henric Johansson. The conecpt is mostly the same, but the implementation differs. Of course I wouldn't have been able to proceed at the speed I'm doing now. Probably I wouldn't have started this project without having made our master thesis.

         <a href="http://www.stallman.org"  TARGET=newwindow >Richard Stallman</a> is a great inspiration. Not only as a programmer.
