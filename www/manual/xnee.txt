Short description
=================

Xnee can record and replay user sessions in the X Windows System
environment.

Summary
=======

Xnee is a suite of programs that can record, replay and   distribute
user actions under the X11 environment.    Think of it as a robot that
can imitate the job you just   did.

   Xnee consists of a library and two applications

   xnee - command line program

   gnee - graphical user interface program

   libxnee - library used by xnee and gnee

Xnee features
=============

Test tool         Instead of performing test cases for a GUI (or CLI
program)         over and over again, the test cases can be automated.
Simply record         a user session and replay it later.

   Performance test tool 	If you want to simulate lots of
simultaneous users in a network (or 	a local machine) you can use Xnee.
Simply record a user 	session and start multiple instances of Xnee.

   Demonstration tool 	You can use Xnee to demonstrate the features of
your program. Simply 	record a user session and replay it later.

   Distribution tool 	If you want to send over your mouse/keyboard
actions to another display 	you can use the built-in
distribution mechanism in Xnee.

   Macro recorder/replayer 	By binding a key and modifier
combination (e.g using xkeymouse)   to replay a recorded session you
will have a Window Manager and   application independent macro.

   File retyper    Xnee can retype the contents of a file. This can be
useful    during tests or if you want xnee to answer some command
session without having to record the session.

Description
===========

The Xnee applications (gnee and xnee) receives X11 protocol data (e.g.
events) from an X server (using libxnee) and print them to a file.
Theses events are later read from the file and replayed.

Events directly generated by the user (e.g KeyPress) can be replayed or
faked. Requests, replies, errors and events not directly generated by
the user (e.g MapNotify) can be recorded as well. By using these data
Xnee can replay with synchronisation. This is not only useful but
essential.

Background
==========

In order to verify that a program does the job it's supposed to do,
certain tests have to be made.  These tests are, IMHO, perhaps the most
boring things a programmer can do. To release the programmer from this
burdon Xnee is made.
Xnee started out as a commad line program. During the development phase
the main functionality was broken out to a library, called libxnee. The
command line program kept the name xnee. The thought behind making the
library was to enable the writing of other clients than just the
command line. Today there is a GUI program, gnee, that uses the library.
By using xnee your testcase(s) can be recorded and later on replayed.
Xnee comes with other features For more information about these, read
the Introduction.

Getting started
***************

Getting started
===============

To get the first feel of Xnee some simple examples are presented.

Simple replay
-------------

Start a terminal emulator (e.g xterm) and then start Xnee,
        `xnee --replay --file example1.xnr &'
   ....dont forget '&'.  The file example1.xnr contains keyboard events
recorded during development of this manual. When replayed you'll see
what was typed and of course more important yu'll get i first glimpse
of Xnee and its capabilities.  For information on where to find the
example files, see below.

Simple recording of Key presses
-------------------------------

We move on to a (very) simple recording session.  Start a terminal
emulator (e.g xterm) and your favorite editor.  Move the pointer to one
of the terminal windows and start Xnee.
        `xnee --record -o exmaple2.xnr --device-event-range 2-3 \'
        `--time 5 --loops 20'
   Move the pointer to the editor and get focus (e.g click the window
frame). After 5 seconds you can type whatever you want to record (20
press- and relase events of the keyboard are recorded). We are done and
you have recorded your first session! Leave the desktop as it is and go
forward to the next example.

Simple replaying of your recorded file
--------------------------------------

Start one terminal emulator (e.g xterm).  Let Xnee repeat the stuff you
did in the example above.  Undo all changes in the editor that was made
in the previous example.  Move the pointer to one of the terminal
windows and start Xnee.
        `xnee --replay -f exmaple2.xnr --time 5'
   Move the pointer to the editor and get focus (e.g click the window
frame). After 5 seconds you will see your typings in the example above
being repeated.

Simple recording of mouse motions
---------------------------------

We move on to another simple recording session.  Start a terminal
emulator (e.g xterm).  Move the pointer to the terminal window and
start Xnee.
        `xnee --record -o exmaple3.xnr --device-event-range 5-6 \'
        `--time 5 --loops 20'
   After 5 seconds you can move the pointer around (20 motion events
are recorded).

Simple replaying of your recorded file
--------------------------------------

Let Xnee repeat the stuff you did in the example above..  Move the
pointer to the terminal window and start Xnee.
        `xnee --replay -f exmaple3.xnr --time 5'
   After 5 seconds you will see your mouse motions in the example above
being repplayed.

Simple retyping of a text file
------------------------------

Let Xnee retype (type again) the text in a text file.  Move the pointer
to the terminal window and create a text file containing the command
`ls -l'.
        `echo "ls -l" > ./mytext.txt'
   And after that you start Xnee.
        `xnee --retype-file  ./mytext.txt --time 5'
   After 5 seconds you will see Xnee type `ls -l', which probably will
list the files in the current directory.

Example Xnee Session files
--------------------------

The example file above (example1.xnr) is a session file that has been
delivered with the sources (allthough not installed), rpm and with the
Xnee Documentation Package. The file(s) can be found:
                       Distribution           Location
                       RPM                    /usr/lib/xnee/session
                       Source                 ./sessions/
                       Document Package       ./sessions/

General ideas
*************

This chapter will give information about key concepts in X11 and Xnee.
It is vital that you read through this chapter.  

Modes
=====

Xnee has four modes:
   * record  (default mode)

   * replay

   * retype

   * distribute
   The distribution mechanism can be used together with the other
three. 

Record
------

When record mode is used Xnee receives a copy of the data sent to and
from the  X server. The copy is printed to a file. Xnee can record
the whole X11 protocol, not just mouse and keyboard events. 

Replay
------

When replay mode is used Xnee reads data from a file or stdin. These
data is  either sent to the server (if it is a keyboard or a mouse
event) or used to  synchronise with (if any of the other data).  

Retype
------

Xnee can retype the contents of a text file. This is useful when
combining  replaying of different recorded session. You can change
the text written in for example an editor (e.g emacs) without having
to re-record the complete sessions.  

Distribution
------------

Xnee can fake mouse and keyboard events on multiple displays. This 
distribution mechanism can be used when recording, replaying or
retyping.  

Ranges
======

What data to record is specified using ranges. Ranges has a start value
and  a stop value. The following data can be recorded:  
        Xnee name                        X Protocol Name
        core-requests                    Request
        device-event                     Event
        delivered-event                  Event
        error                            Error
        reply                            Reply
        ext-requests.ext-major           Extension Request
        ext-requests.ext-minor           Extension Request
        ext-replies.ext-major            Extension Reply
        ext-replies.ext-minor            Extension Reply
   When specifying the ranges when using xnee you can either type the
integer value  of the data or the name of the data. To find out what
number belongs to what  data name, you can use the
`--print-data-name' option. For an explanation  of the X protocol
data, please read the "X Record Extension Library" or the  "Record
Extension Protocol Specification".  

First and last motion event
===========================

Xnee has the ability to skip recording of succesive motion events with
no  other data in between. This option is intended to reduce the
number of data  recorded by leaving out unnecessary data. This
feature can be invoked with  the `--first-last' flag. 

Delay
=====

Sometimes when Xnee starts recording data, the keyrelease (caused by
pressing and  releasing RETURN to execute the Xnee command line) is
recorded. This single  keyrelease (with no corresponding keypress)
might confuse the X server.  With the `--time <secs>' option Xnee can
be paused for a number of seconds  before
recording/replaying/retyping starts.  

Verbose
=======

When enabling verbose mode (`--verbose') Xnee prints a lot of
information  about it's state. This option is only intended for
runtime debugging. 

Human printouts
===============

Sometimes it's hard to decide what data to use when synchronising. To
do this  you have to analyse what data is sent from the server when
recording. Instead of  reading the data number, s tring
representation of the data is printed out.  To enable this option,
use the `--human-printouts'.  

Invoking Xnee
=============

The mode(s) Xnee shall use and the ranges to use can be set by either:
   * command line options

   * project file (only applicable when in record mode)

   * session file (only applicable when in replay mode)
   

Command line syntax
-------------------

To get information about how to use Xnee's command line options see
the man page, info page or use the `--help' option.   

Project file
------------

To use a project file use the `--project' option,  e.g 
     `xnee --project xnee/projects/netscape.xnp'
   

Session file
------------

To use a recorded session file use the `--file' option,  e.g 
     `xnee --file user1_session.xnee'
    

Interupting Xnee
================

Interupting Xnee when recording or replaying can be done as follows
   * user specified modifier and key

   * limit the number of data to record

   * sending a SIGTERM signal (e.g pressing Control-c in a terminal
     window)
   The prefered way to interrupt xnee is to use the modifier+key.  

modifier and key
----------------

It is possible to specify a modifier (e.g Control button) and a key
(e.g 'a')  that will stop the Xnee session. When using this option
make sure that the modifier/key is not used in any way by the
applications you are recording.  You can specify a key+modifier to
stop, pause and resume xnee. You can also  insert a mark in the
recorded session file.  

limit the number of data to record
----------------------------------

By specifying the number of data to record (`--loops') xnee stops when
this number  of data is received from the server. When replaying the
same amount of data  is replayed.  

sending a SIGTERM signal
------------------------

The easiest way to send a signal to a process is by launching Xnee from
a  terminal window (e.g xterm) and then press Control-c which will
send the SIGTERM  signal to Xnee. When replaying it can sometimes be
hard to move the pointer  into the terminal window (e.g if a lot of
motion events were recorded that  will let you compete with Xnee on
where the mouse pointer shall be located.  Beleive me, you'll end up
lossing that battle).  

Using Xnee plugins
==================

Xnee supports plugins since version 1.07. For information about how to
write  plugins, download the source code and look at the plugin
example which shall  be delivered with Xnee.

Examples
********

Recorder
========

Record mouse motions
--------------------

Record mouse motions only and save the session to mouse-rec.xnl.
        `xnee --record --mouse --out mouse-rec.xnl'
   After having typed this you can move your mouse round for a while.
After Xnee has exited you will be able to replay your motions. Xnee
will stop after having record 100 events (this is the default
behaviour).

Record keyboard
---------------

Record keyboard events only and save log to kbd-rec.xnl.
        `xnee --record --mouse --out kbd-rec.xnl'
   After having typed this Xnee records all your keyboard actions.
After Xnee has exited you will be able to replay your keyboard actions.
Xnee will stop after having record 100 events (this is the default
behaviour).

Record keyboard and mouse
-------------------------

Record keyboard and mouse and save log to km-rec.xnl.
        `xnee --record --keyboard --mouse --out kbd-rec.xnl'
   After having typed this Xnee records all your keyboard and mouse
actions.  So now move your pointer and write some stuff with your
keyboard. After Xnee has exited you will be able to replay your
keyboard and mouse actions. Xnee will stop after having record 100
events (this is the default behaviour).

Record a gnumeric session
-------------------------

Record a galeon session. Record 400 events. Save output in file
galeon.xnl Start a terminal emulator (e.g xterm)
     `xterm&'

   Start Xnee
        `xnee --record --keyboard --mouse --loops 400 --out gnumeric.xnl&'

   Start galeon
     `gnumeric&'
   Start using gnumeric. Browse the menus above, reset the fonts etc.

Record a gnumeric session with synchronisation data
---------------------------------------------------

Record a gnumeric session. Record 400 events. Save output in file
gnumeric2.xnl

Start a terminal emulator (e.g xterm) `xterm&'

   Start Xnee
        `xnee --record --keyboard --mouse --loops 400 --out gnumeric2.xnl\'
        `--delivered-event-range Expose,MapRequest,LeaveNotify,EnterNotify  &'

Start galeon `gnumeric&' Start using gnumeric. Browse the menus above,
reset the fonts etc.

Replayer
========

Replay mouse motions
--------------------

Replay mouse motions as found in the file mouse-rec.xnl.
        `xnee --replay  --file mouse-rec.xnl'
   Xnee will now imitate exactly what you did when you recorded this
file.

Replay mouse motions using with half speed
------------------------------------------

Replay mouse motions as found in the file mouse-rec.xnl but with the
speed set to 50% of the recorded.
        `xnee --replay  --file mouse-rec.xnl --speed-percent 50'
   Xnee will now imitate exactly what you did when you recorded this
file, allthough it will be done in 50% of the recorded time.

Replay mouse motions using with double speed
--------------------------------------------

Replay mouse motions as found in the file mouse-rec.xnl but with the
speed set to 200% of the recorded.
        `xnee --replay  --file mouse-rec.xnl --speed-percent 200'
   Xnee will now imitate exactly what you did when you recorded this
file, allthough it will be done twice as fast as when recorded.

Replay keyboard actions
-----------------------

Replay keyboard events from file kbd-rec.xnl.
        `xnee --replay --file kbd-rec.xnl'
   After having typed this Xnee replays all your keyboard actions.
After Xnee has exited you will be able to replay your keyboard actions.

Replay keyboard and mouse
-------------------------

Replay keyboard and mouse from the file km-rec.xnl.
        `xnee --replay --keyboard --mouse --file kbd-rec.xnl'
   After having typed this Xnee replays all your keyboard and mouse
actions.  Xnee moves your pointer and writes the the same stuff as you
did when recording.

Replay a gnumeric session
-------------------------

Replay the gnumeric session above
Start a terminal emulator (e.g xterm) `xterm&' Start a new fresh
gnumeric spreadsheet `gnumeric&'

   Start Xnee
        `xnee --replay  --file gnumeric.xnl'
   Xnee will now do the same stuff you did when recording. It may happen
that some user actions are replayed to early. This is so because Xnee
has no way of knowing if it is in sync with the recorded session.

Replay a galeon session with synchronisation data
-------------------------------------------------

Replay the second gnumeric session above.
Start a terminal emulator (e.g xterm) `xterm&' Start a new fresh
gnumeric spreadsheet `gnumeric&'

   Start Xnee
        `xnee --replay  --file gnumeric2.xnl'
   Xnee will now do the same stuff you did when recording. It may happen
that the replaying slows down. This is because Xnee is currently out of
sync.  When being out of sync Xnee slows down a bit and checks the
thresholds if it is allowed to continue. Xnee will most probably find
itself in sync after a short while. All recorded user actions should
have occured the same way as when recording.

Replay a galeon session with synchronisation data setting threshold
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Replay the second gnumeric session above.
Start a terminal emulator (e.g xterm) `xterm&' Start a new fresh
gnumeric spreadsheet `gnumeric&'

Retyper
=======

Retype the help printout
------------------------

If you want Xnee to fake a user typing the help printout from xnee you
can use the `--type-help' option.
Start a terminal emulator (e.g xterm) and an editor (e.g emacs).
     `xterm &'

     `emacs &'
   Retype the help printout by starting xnee with a 10 seconds delay
delay.
     `xnee --time 10 --type-help'
   Move your mouse to the editor and make the editor have focus.  Wait
a few seconds and xnee will type the help. You will now also have a
copy of help text.

Retype a file
-------------

If you want Xnee to fake a user typing the letters as found in a text
file you can use the retype mode. Note that it isn't possible to retype
all characters yet. This will be implemented as soon as possible. We'll
give an example on how to use this mode.
Start a terminal emulator (e.g xterm)
     `xterm &'
   Create a text file
     `echo "Hi Xnee" > testfile.txt'

   Retype the contents of this file to another file by starting xnee
with a 10 seconds delay delay.
     `xnee --time 10 --retype-file testfile.txt'
   Start the fabulous editor `cat'
     `cat > copiedfile.txt'
   Wait a few seconds and xnee will retype the letters in the file
`testfile.txt'. You will now also have a copy of that file.  The copy
is called copiedfile.txt. This is a realy a stupid way to copy a file
but this option opens up a few possibilities.

Distributor
===========

With the distribution mode Xnee can send your device events to multiple
displays.

Distribute your mouse motions
-----------------------------

You can distribute your mouse motions to the displays frodo:0.0 and
sam:0.0
Start a terminal emulator (e.g xterm)
     `xterm &'
   Start xnee
     `xnee --distribute frodo:0,sam:0.0'
     ` --record --mouse'

   If you have setup authority correct on frodo and sam you will see
all you mouse motions being done on thos displays as well.

Distribute the replaying of mouse motions
-----------------------------------------

Replay and distribute mouse motions as found in the file
`mouse-rec.xnl'.
        `xnee --replay  --file mouse-rec.xnl'
        ` --distribute frodo:0,sam:0.0'
   Xnee will now imitate exactly what you did when you recorded this
file on your host as well on frodo and sam.

Distribute the retyping of a file
---------------------------------

If you want Xnee to to distribute the fakeing of a user typing the
letters as found in a text file you can use the retype mode together
with the distribution mode.
Start a terminal emulator (e.g xterm) on each of the hosts
     `xterm &'
   Create a text file.
     `echo "Hi again Xnee" > distfile.txt'

   Retype the contents of this file to another file by starting xnee
with a 10 seconds delay delay.
     `xnee --time 10 --retype-file distfile.txt'
     ` --distribute frodo:0,sam:0.0 '
   Start the fabulous editor `cat' on the terminal emulators on each the
terminals.
     `cat > copiedfile.txt'

If you have setup authority correct on frodo and sam you will, after a
few seconds, see xnee retype the letters in the file `distfile.txt'.
You will now also have three copies of that file.  On copy on each
host. The copy is called copiedfile.txt. This might seem like a stupid
way to copy a file to three locations but this is just an example.

Key and modofiers
=================

Stop Xnee with key + modifier
-----------------------------

You can stop xnee by specifying a key and modifier combination. Make
sure that this key modifier isn't grabbed by another X client (e.g by
the Window Manager). Let's say that you want Xnee to stop recording if
you press Control and h.
        `xnee --record --mouse --loops -1 --stop-key Control,h'
   This will make xnee record mouse events until you press Control and
h.  All printouts are done to stdout so you can see that Xnee stops
when you press the key and modifier.
Move your mouse for a while and you'll see xnee print out lots of lines.
Press Control and h.
Xnee will now have stopped recording.

Pausing and resuming Xnee with key + modifier
---------------------------------------------

You can pause and resum xnee by specifying a key and modifier
combination.  Make sure that this key modifier isn't grabbed by another
X client (e.g by the Window Manager). Let's say that you want Xnee to
pause recording if you press Control and p and to resume when pressing
Comntrol and r.
        `xnee --record --mouse --loops -1 --pause-key Control,p \'
        `--resume-key Control,r'
   This will make xnee record mouse events until you press Control and
p.  All printouts are done to stdout so you can see that Xnee stops
when you press the key and modifier.
Move your mouse for a while and you'll see xnee print out lots of lines.
Press Control and p.
Xnee will now have paused recording. Move your mouse for a while and
note that nothing is printed.
Press Control and r.
Xnee will now have resumed recording. Move your mouse for a while and
note that xnee begins its printouts.

Using macro
===========

Macors can be used in various applications allthough many applicaions
have a macro functionality built in (e.g emacs).

Define a simple macro
---------------------

There are plenty of tools that bind a key + modifier combination to
different actions. For various reasons the author of this manual is
familliar with xkeymouse so we will use xkeymouse in this example.
The first thing to do is to decide which key + modifier combination to
tie to the wanted action. Let's say we want to use one of the funtion
keys, F1.  We then have to find out which keycode belongs to that key.
The action we will bind to this key + modifier combination will be the
replaying of a recorded session from the previous examples.
We use Xnee to find the keycode for F1. Start xnee.
        `xnee --record --keyboard --loops 20'
   Press the F1 key and see what number was printed out. It will look
something like this:
     `0,2,0,0,0,67,0,90300078'
     `0,3,0,0,0,67,0,90300156'
   The interesting part here is the 6th column. In our example we find
67, which is the keycode for F1.
Now we move on to setup xkeymouse to grab F1 and bind that to replay the
mouse motions from the file `mouse-rec.xnl'. Open or create a new file
in your home directory called `.xkmrc' and add the lines.
     `keycode=67, 0, Exec, xnee,  --replay --file mouse-rec.xnl, \'
     `Fork, NoAutoRepeat'
   Let's try it. Start xkeymouse with verbose printouts.
     `xkeymouse --verbose'
   Press F1 and the recorded session from the previous example shall be
replayed. You can also see in the verbose printouts that xkeymouse
executes xnee.

Define another simple macro
---------------------------

Let's say we want to bind Control and e to execute the session as in the
example above. This time setting up xkeymouse is a bit easier.
Setup xkeymouse to grab F1 and bind that to replay the mouse motions
from the file `mouse-rec.xnl' by opening or create a new file in your
home directory called `.xkmrc' and add the lines.
     `e, Control, Exec, xnee,  --replay --file mouse-rec.xnl, \'
     `Fork, NoAutoRepeat'
   Let's try it. Start xkeymouse with verbose printouts.
     `xkeymouse --verbose'
   Press Control and e and the recorded session from the previous
example shall be replayed.

Various options
===============

Using verbose mode
------------------

To enable verbose mode, start xnee like this
     `xkeymouse --verbose --record --mouse'
   Move the mouse for a while and you'll lots of verbose printouts that
usualy isn't there.

Using human readable printouts
------------------------------

To enable human printout mode, start xnee like this
     `xkeymouse --human-printouts --record --mouse'
   Move the mouse for a while and you'll see the data printed out in an
almost human friendly format.

Using a differet screen resolution
----------------------------------

If a session was recorded on a screen with another resolution than on
the one where we replay the session xnee will translate all coordinates
automagically. However, you can force xnee to use a specific resolution
when replaying. To do this, start xnee like this
     `xkeymouse --replay --file mouse-rec.xnl \ '
     `--replay-resolution  800x600'
   Xnee will now replay the events recorded in the sessions file
`mouse-rec.xnl' as if the screen has a resolution of 800x600.

Using no resolution translation
-------------------------------

If a session was recorded on a screen with another resolution than the
on the one where we replay the session xnee will translate all
coordinates automagically. However, you can force xnee not to use
translation. To do this, start xnee like this
     `xkeymouse --replay --file mouse-rec.xnl \ '
     `--no-resolution-adjustment'
   Xnee will now replay the events recorded in the sessions file
`mouse-rec.xnl' as if the screen had the same resolution the recorded
one.

Record another display than the default
---------------------------------------

If you want to record another display than the default, as set in the
DISPLAY variable, you use the `--display' option.
     `xkeymouse --record --mouse --display frodo:0.0 '
   Xnee will now record the mouse events on the display frodo:0.0.

Replay to another display than the default
------------------------------------------

If you want to replat to another display than the default, as set in the
DISPLAY variable, you use the `--display' option.
     `xkeymouse --replay --display frodo:0.0 --file mouse-rec.xnl '
   Xnee will now replay the mouse events on the display frodo:0.0.

Xnee Internals
**************

This chapter is intended to explain the internal design of libxnee.
Hopefully this will lead to a better understanding of how to use Xnee
and why some features exists and why some doesn't.

Project file
============

Xnee can be set either using command line options (when using xnee) or
by clicking the correct buttons etc in the GUI (using gnee). Instead of
setting the same settings over and over again, you can use the Xnee
Project File.

Create a project file
---------------------

You can create a project by yourself. This can be done using the
`write-settings' option in xnee or the "save settings to file" when
using gnee. You can also write one by yourself in your favorite editor.
For information about how to do this, read the chapter 'Project file
syntax'.

X-LIST is a comma separated list of RANGE, e.g
     `12-15,17,22-29,KeyPress-MotionNotify,ButtonPress'

Session file
============

The Xnee session files are the printouts from a recorded session. The
lines in the session file can be either of the following:

`Replayable data'

`Synchronisation data'

`Xnee setup data'

`Insert marks'

Replayable data
---------------

A text representation of the recorded device event.         Example:
   `0,3,0,0,0,28,0,3182009792')

Synchronisation data
--------------------

A text representation of the recorded non device event

Xnee setup data
---------------

Information about how Xnee was setup when recording this session.
 Examples:        `       #   device_event:            2-3'

Xnee meta data
--------------

Information about the evnironment used when recording the seesion
Examples:        `# Nodename:             laphroaig'

Insert marks
------------

This is intended to be used in the future when Xnee will be scriptable.
      Insert marks are inserted using a key+modifier during recording.

Key and modifier
================

When wanting to interupt Xnee from its current action it may sometimes
be hard to send a signal. Because of this Xnee has been added support
to grab key and modifiers that can be bound to various xnee actions.
You can specify a key + modifier combination and bind that to either
one of the following actions:
`stop'

`pause'

`resume'

`insert mark'

Stop Xnee with key+modifier combination
---------------------------------------

Xnee stops its current action when the user presses the key+modifier
combination as specified during setup. Xnee will be shut gracefully.

Pause Xnee with key+modifier combination
----------------------------------------

Xnee pause its current action when the user presses the key+modifier
combination as specified during setup. Xnee will be in paused mode until
the user stops or resumes Xnee.

Pause Xnee with key+modifier combination
----------------------------------------

Xnee resumes its current paused action when the user presses the
key+modifier combination as specified during setup. Xnee will continue
where it was paused.

Insert marks Xnee with key+modifier combination
-----------------------------------------------

When the user presses the key+modifier combination as specified during
setup Xnee will print a mark in the session file containing a time
stamp. This feature is intended be used when you want to mark an
interresting time/event during recording.  After recording has finished
you can add Xnee scripting calls to Xnee which will be interpreted and
executed as if they were recorded.

Stop key and modifier syntax
----------------------------

Setting stop key and modifier is done using the `--stop-key' option.
     `xnee --record --mouse --stop-key Control,e'
   This will make Xnee stop its current action when the user presses
Control and e.

Pause key and modifier syntax
-----------------------------

Setting pause key and modifier is done using the `--pause-key' option.
     `xnee --record --mouse --pause-key Control,p'
   This will make Xnee pause its current action when the user presses
Control and p.

Resume key and modifier syntax
------------------------------

Setting stop resume and modifier is done using the `--resume-key'
option.
     `xnee --record --mouse --resume-key Control,r'
   This will make Xnee resume its paused action when the user presses
Control and r.

Insert key and modifier syntax
------------------------------

Setting insert key and modifier is done using the `--insert-key' option.
     `xnee --record --mouse --insert-key Control,i'
   This will make Xnee insert a mark in the session file when the user
presses Control and i.

Key syntax
----------

You can set the key by entering one character or the keycode for the
character you wish to use.

Modifier syntax
---------------

Modifiers can be set to a '+' separated list of any of the following.
`Shift or Shift'
     Modifier is set to the Shift key

`LockMask or Lock'
     Modifier is set to the Lock key

`Control or ctrl'
     Modifier is set to the Control key

`Mod1Mask or m1m'
     Modifier is set to

`Mod2Mask or m2m'
     Modifier is set to

`Mod3Mask or m3m'
     Modifier is set to

`Mod4Mask or m4m'
     Modifier is set to

`Mod5Mask or m5m'
     Modifier is set to

`Alt_L'
     Modifier is set to Alt_L

`Alt_L'
     Modifier is set to Alt_R

`Alt'
     Modifier is set to be any of Alt_L and Alt_R

`Shift_R'
     Modifier is set to Shift_R

`Shift_L'
     Modifier is set to Shift_L

`Shift'
     Modifier is set to be any of Shift_L and Shift_R

`Control_R'
     Modifier is set to Control_R

`Control_L'
     Modifier is set to Control_L

`Control'
     Modifier is set to be any of Control_L and Control_R

`Scroll'
     Modifier is set Scroll

`Caps_Lock'
     Modifier is set Caps Lock

`AnyModifier or any'
     Modifier is set to any of the modifier

`none or 0'
     No modifier is used

   You can also specify the keycode for the modifier you wish to use

Modifier+key examples
=====================

If you want to set the modifier to be a combination of Control, Alt and
Shift you spearate them with a `+' sign.
     `Control+Alt+Shift'

   If you want to make Xnee stop when pressing the above modifier
combination and the key y, you type
     `--stop-key Control+Alt+Shift,y'

Synchronisation
***************

We will try to go through the basics of how Xnee implememnts
synchronisation and try to tell you, by using examples, why
synhronisation is important.

Why synchronise
===============

To understand why synchronisation during replay is needed an example is
given.

   In this example only mouse and keyboard events are recorded. Think
of a session with a web browser.

   During record the following is done:
   * Start galeon (or another web browser) via the GNOME panel

   * Press Ctrl-O which pops up a window

   * Press the left button in the textfield of the popup window

   * Enter the URL you want to enter (e.g <http://www.gnu.org>)

   * Click on the OK button

   * Then click on another URL (e.g GNU Documentation)

   * Then click on another URL (e.g On-Line Documentation)

   When replaying this session it is often to synchronise the recorded
session with what's happening "right now" on the display since
sometimes (or rather always) there can be different response times from
the same URL.

   During replay the following is done:
   * Galeon is started

   * Ctrl-O is typed which pops up a window

   * Press the left button in the textfield of the popup window

   * Enter the URL you want to enter (e.g <http://www.gnu.org>)

   * Clock on the OK button

   * ... due to an enormous amount of visitors the GNU web server can't
     respond as quick as it did when recording. So when the next thing
     happens

   * Then click on another URL (e.g GNU Documentation)

   * ... the page hasn't been loaded and when the next event is replayed

   * Then click on another URL (e.g On-Line Documentation)

   * ... the link isn't there and we're really out of sync with the
     recorded session

How to synchronise
==================

Instead we could record some more data than just the mouse and keyboard
events.

   During record the following is done:
   * Start galeon (or another web browser) via the GNOME panel

   * Record some X data that tells us that a window have been created

   * Press Ctrl-O which pops up a window

   * Record some X data that tells us that a window have been created

   * Press the left button in the textfield of the popup window

   * Enter the URL you want to enter (e.g <http://www.gnu.org>)

   * Clock on the OK button

   * Record some X data that tells us that a window have been destroyed

   * Then click on another URL (e.g GNU Documentation)

   * Record some X data that tells us that a some text has been
     displayed in a window

   * Then click on another URL (e.g On-Line Documentation)

   * Record some X data that tells us that a some text has been
     displayed in a window
   The non-mouse-or-keyboard events recorded (window created & text
displayed) are record for synchronisation purposes.

   During replay the following is done:
   * Start galeon (or another web browser) via the GNOME panel

   * wait for: the recorded X data to be sent again

   * Press Ctrl-O which pops up a window

   * wait for: the recorded X data to be sent again

   * Press the left button in the textfield of the popup window

   * Enter the URL you want to enter (e.g <http://www.gnu.org>)

   * Clock on the OK button

   * wait for: the recorded X data to be sent again

   * Then click on another URL (e.g GNU Documentation)

   * wait for: the recorded X data to be sent again

   * Then click on another URL (e.g On-Line Documentation)

   * wait for: the recorded X data to be sent again

Synchronisation is needed
=========================

So by recording more data than just the events to be replayed we can
synchornise what was recorded with what is going on when replaying. But
the data has to be choosen with respect to that the data:
   * differs from different sessions (Gimp and Xterm are really
     different)

   * slows down the replay session if there are too many

   * is hard to choose since the X protocol is rich

   * differs (comparing record and replaying)

   * can have different ordering (comparing record and replaying)

Different data for different kind of sessions
---------------------------------------------

If we record an xterm session with all data being recorded and compare
that to a recorded GIMP session with all data being recordr we can see
that the data to use as synchronisation data differs. AS an example
there aren't so many windows created/destryed during an xterm session.

   The solve to the the problem of finding out what data to use as
synchronisation data one can:
   * use the project files delivered with Xnee

   * analyse the application (using Xnee's  `--human-printouts' option)
     and do some "trial and error"

Slow replay session due to too many synchronise data
----------------------------------------------------

The synchronisation itself doesn't take much time but there are
timeouts that makes Xnee paues for a short while (see above). If there
are many such timeouts it will lead to a slow or shaky replaying
session.

X protocol is rich
------------------

For an end user (with no X expertise) it is hard to read the X protocol
specification and make assumptions on what data to use.

Different data sent
-------------------

Even if one starts up a machine from scratch (reboot) when recording
and from scratch when replaying there is no guarantee that the data is
sent in the same order or that exactly the same amount of data is sent.

Buffers and timeouts
====================

To enable synchronisation Xnee buffers data:
   * that was read in the session file but hasn't been sent during
     replay

   * that was sent during replay but hasn't been seen in the session
          file being replayed
   For every data read from session file (during replay) that isn't
replayable (i e device event) Xnee stores the data in a buffer. Xnee
also stores the data sent from the X server during playback. The data
received from the server make the buffer entry for that specific data
be decremented. If, on the other hand, the same data was read from file
the buffer entry for that data is incremented.  Before replaying any
replayable event Xnee makes sure it is in sync. If Xnee is in sync the
replaying continues. If Xnee is out of sync it will look for its
thresholds and see if it is inside a user specified range. There are
three thresholds:
   * positive maximum  nr data read from session file

   * negative minimum  nr of data sent from X server

   * absolute total maximum sum of the absolute values above
   If Xnee read one data from file (e.g the event MapNotify) Xnee
checks if the buffer entry for the specific data is bigger than the
positive maximum value (after having incremented the buffer value).

   If Xnee receives one data from the X server (e.g the event
MapNotify) it checks if the  buffer entry for the specific data is
bigger than the negative minimum value (after having decremented the
buffer value).

   Xnee also checks if the absolute sum of the diferences for every
entry in the buffer is higher the a total threshold.

   If Xnee is getting out of sync it slows down the speed a bit and
tries to continue. However after a while it may happen that Xnee
considers that it no use to continue since we are too much out of sync.
Xnee compensates for the delay during replay that is caused when being
out of sync.
It is possible to tweak the thresholds using the `--maximum-threshold',
`--negative-threshold' and `--total-diff-threshold' options. Is is also
possible to turn off synchronisation completely using the `--no-sync'
option.

Xnee Requirements
*****************

Runtime requirements
====================

Xnee requirements:
   * RECORD extension

   * XTest extension
   You can use Xnee in replaying mode without RECORD extension if
synchronisation is turned off.

Development requirements
========================

For development requirements, please look at the DEVELOPMENT file that
is distributed with all packages and with CVS.

FAQ
***

`Where do I send questions?'
     <info-xnee@gnu.org>
`Where and how do I report bugs?'
     Turn on verbose mode `xnee --verbose' and save the printouts.
     Include all printouts and log files in the mail which is sent to
     <xnee-bug@gnu.org>
`When setting ranges (integers), how do I know what numbers belong'
     to X11 data?  You can either type the data name directly (e.g
     MotionNotify) or you can use the print-xxx-name options.
        * `--print-data-name'

        * `--print-event-name'

        * `--print-error-name'

        * `--print-reply-name'

        * `--print-request-name'

`Can Xnee record more than one display?'
     No, but we are considering adding the functionality (see the TODO
     file)

`Where is the CVS repository?'
     You can find a CVS tree at <http://savannah.gnu.org>.   You are
     more than welcome to join

`Is there a GUI frontend for Xnee ?'
     Yes! Gnee.

`What license is Xnee released under ?'
     GPL. Which can be found at <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html>

`Why the name Xnee?'
     We wanted to use a recursive acronym, as GNU ("GNU's Not Unix').
     After having read the Wine documentation, we thought that Xnee is
     not an Event Emulator would work fine since Xnee is Not an Event
     Emulator but rather a event recorder and faker.

`What does the name Gnee mean?'
     Gnee's not an Emulator Either

`What doesn't the name Gnee mean?'
     Gnee's not an Event Emulator

`Can you add xxx functionality to Xnee'
     Send an email to <xnee-devel@gnu.org> and we'll consider it.

`When starting Xnee I get noticed that I am missing RECORD extension'
     Your X server doesn't have the RECORD extension either loaded or
     compiled. To solve this you have to, depending on what Xserver you
     have do the following:

        * XFree86 4.0 and higher Make sure that the RECORD extension is
          loaded. This is done by letting the Module section in the X
          config file (e.g /etc/X11/XF86Config-4) look something like:

          `Section "Module"'
          `Load  "dbe"         # Double-buffering'
          `Load  "GLcore"      # OpenGL support'
          `Load  "dri"         # Direct rendering infrastructure'
          `Load  "glx"         # OpenGL X protocol interface'
          `Load  "extmod"      # Misc. required extensions'
          `Load  "v4l"         # Video4Linux'
          `# Load  "pex5"      # PHIGS for X 3D environment (obsolete)'
          `Load  "record"      # X event recorder'
          `# Load  "xie"       # X Image Extension (obsolete)'
          `# You only need the following two modules if you do not use
          xfs.'
          `# Load  "freetype"  # TrueType font handler'
          `# Load  "type1"     # Adobe Type 1 font handler'
          EndSection

          The important load directive (in this case) is the following
          line
          `Load  "record"  # X event recorder'
        * X.org, XFree86 (3.3 and lower)  or any other Xserver
          Recompile and reinstall the Xserver and make sure that RECORD
          extension is built into the Xserver. Please look at the
          documentation from your Xserver "vendor" on how to do that.

`How do I build VNC so that I can use Xnee together with it?'
     Download vnc source from:
     <http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/xvnchistory.html>
     In the file `Xvnc/config/cf/vnc.def' change NO on the following
     items to YES as below:
     `#define BuildRECORD YES'
     `#define BuildRECORDlib YES'
     Download the Xfree86 distribution from <http://www.xfree86.org>.
     Specifically, the following dir, (currently in the file
     `X430src-3.tgz file' ):
     `tar zxvf \'

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warrany Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.
