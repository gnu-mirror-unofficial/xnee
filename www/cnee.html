	  <h2>Summary</h2>
          cnee is a command line program using libxnee.
	  <br>
          With cnee you can record and replay user actions
          just as you can with <a href="gnee.html">gnee</a>.
          <br>
          <br>
	  <h2>Background</h2>
	  The whole projext started as being one command line program, cnee.
	  cnee was initially called xnee. When the Xnee project
	  got bigger and more used the idea of a GUI program came up
	  (today <a href="gnee.html">gnee</a>) we decided to split Xnee 
	  into two parts. One library (today <a href="libxnee.html">
	  libxnee</a>) and one program (today <a href="cnee.html">cnee</a>).
	  <br>
	  <h2>Features</h2>
	  cnee comes with all features that is offered by 
	  <a href="libxnee.html">libxnee</a>. The same features are offered 
	  by the GUI program <a href="gnee.html">gnee</a>. There is, however,
	  one major thing that you only can do with cnee:
	  <br>
	  <DL>
            <DT>
              <DD>do unattended and autamoatic regression 
	      test (e.g using cron)</DD>
	    </DT>
          </DL>
	  This might seems to be a rather useless feature. It is not!
	  <br>
	  <DL>Main features:
            <DT>
              <DD>- record an Xnee session file</DD>
              <DD>- replay an Xnee session file</DD>
              <DD>- create/write Xnee project files</DD>
              <DD>- read Xnee project files</DD>
              <DD>- distribute device events to multiple displays</DD>
	    </DT>
          </DL>
