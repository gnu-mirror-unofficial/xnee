@node Usage
@chapter Xnee usage

@section Getting started with Xnee
@cindex Getting started
To get the first feel of Xnee four examples are presented.

@subsection Simple replay
Start one terminal emulator (e.g xterm)
Start Xnee, 
@example
   @code{xnee -rep -f example1.xnr &}
@end example
....dont forget '&'.
The file example1.xnr contains keyboard events recorded during development of this manual. 
When replayed you'll what was typed and of course more important yu'll get i first glimpse 
of Xnee and its capabilities.

@subsection Simple recording
We move on to a (very) simple recording session
Start a terminal emulator (e.g xterm) and your favorite editor.
Move the pointer to one of the terminal windows and start Xnee.
@example
   @code{xnee -o exmaple2.xnr --device-event-range 2-3 --time 5 --loops 20}
@end example
Move the pointer to the pther terminal windows and get focus (e.g click the window frame)
After 5 seconds you can type whatever you want to record (20 press/relase of the keyboard are recorded).
We are done, you have recorded your first session!
Leave the desktop as it is and go for the next example.

@subsection Simple replaying of you recorded file
Let Xnee repeat the stuff you did in example 2. 
Undo all changes in the editor that was made in the previous example.
Move the pointer to one of the terminal windows and start Xnee.
@example
   @code{xnee -rep -f exmaple2.xnr --time 5}
@end example
Move the pointer to the pther terminal windows and get focus (e.g click the window frame)
After 5 seconds you will see your typings in the example above being repeated.

@subsection Recorded session files
@cindex recorded session file
The example file above (example1.xnr) is a session file that has been delivered with the sources 
(allthough not installed), rpm and with the Xnee Documentation Package. The file(s) can be found:
@multitable  @columnfractions .30 .30 .30 
@item
@tab @b{Distribution}
@tab @b{Location}

@item
@tab RPM
@tab /usr/lib/xnee/sessions

@item

@tab ./sessions/

@end multitable



@section  Modes
@cindex modes
Xnee has three modes:
@itemize @bullet
@item	record  (default mode)
@item	replay
@item	distribute
@end itemize
The distributiion mechanism can be used together with the other two.


@subsection  Record
@cindex recording
When record mode is used Xnee receives a copy of the data sent to and from the X server. The copy is printed to either stdout or a file. Xnee can record more data than only mouse and keyboard events.


@subsection  Replay
@cindex replaying
When replay mode is used Xnee reads data from a file or stdin. These data is either sent to the server (if it is a keyboard or a mouse event) or used to synchronise with (if any of the other data).


@subsection  Distribution
@cindex distributing
Xnee can distribute mouse and keyboard events to multiple displays. The distribution mechanism can be used when recording as well as when replaying.


@section  Ranges
@cindex ranges
What data to record is specified using ranges. Ranges has a start value and a stop value. The following data can be recorded: 

@multitable  @columnfractions .10 .45 .45 
@item
@tab @b{Xnee name}
@tab @b{X Protocol Name}

@item
@tab core-requests
@tab Request

@item
@tab device-event		
@tab Event 

@item
@tab delivered-event		
@tab Event

@item
@tab error			
@tab Error

@item
@tab reply			
@tab Reply

@item
@tab ext-requests.ext-major	
@tab Extension Request

@item
@tab ext-requests.ext-minor	
@tab Extension Request

@item
@tab ext-replies.ext-major	
@tab Extension Reply

@item
@tab ext-replies.ext-minor	
@tab Extension Reply

@end multitable
For an explanation on the X protocol data, please read the "X Record Extension Library" or the "Record Extension Protocol Specification".


@section  First and last motion event
Xnee has the ability to skip recording of succesive motion events with no other data in between. This option is intended to reduce the number of data recorded by leaving out unnecessary data. This feature can be invoked with the --first-last flag.

@section  Delay
Sometimes when Xnee starts recording data, the keyrelease (due to pressing and releasing RETURN to execute the Xnee command line) is recorded. This single keyrelease (with no corresponding keypress) might confuse the X server. With the --time <secs> option Xnee can be paused for secs seconds.


@section  Verbose
When enabling verbose mode (--verbose) Xnee prints a lot of information about it's state. This option is only intended for debugging. 

@section  Human printouts
Sometimes it's hard to decide what data to use when synchronising. To do this you simply have to see what data is printed out when recording. Instead of reading the data number, s tring representation of the data is printed out. To enable this option, use the "--human-printouts"

@section  Plugin file
Xnee's behaviour can be set using a prepared file containing the settings to be used.

@end table
You can also specify the keycode for the modifier you wish to use


@section  Invoking Xnee
The mode(s) Xnee shall use and the ranges to use can be set by either:
@itemize @bullet
@item	command line options
@item	plugin file
@item	recorded file (only apllicable when in replay mode)
@end itemize
The three can be used together or alone. However, when given multiple specifications to a setting that can take one value (e.g printout redirection, number of data to record) the latest specification is used.

@subsection  Command line syntax
@cindex command line syntax
To get information about how to use Xnee's command line options please use the man page(s).

@subsection  Plugin file
To use a plugin file use the @code{--plugin} option,  e.g @code{xnee --plugin xnee/plugins/netscape.xns}

@subsection  Recorded file
To use a recorded file use the @code{--file} option,  e.g @code{xnee --file user1_session.xnee}


@section  Stopping Xnee
@cindex stopping xnee
Stopping Xnee when recording or replaying can be done as follows
@itemize @bullet
@item	user specified modifier and key
@item	number of data to record
@item	sending a SIGTERM signal (e.g pressing Control-c in a terminal window)
@end itemize

@subsection	user specified modifier and key
@cindex stop modifier
@cindex stop key
It is possible to specify a modifier (e.g Control button) and a key (e.g 'a') that will stop the Xnee session. When using this option make sure that the modifier/key is not used in any way by the applications you recording.
@subsection	number of data to record
By specifying the number of data to record Xnee stops when this number num,ber of data is received from the server. When replaying the same amount of data is replayed. 
@subsection	sending a SIGTERM signal (e.g pressing CTRL-C in a terminal window)
@cindex SIGTERM
The easiest way to send a signal to a process is by launching Xnee from a terminal window (e.g xterm). By pressing Control-c xterm sends the SIGTERM signal to Xnee. When replaying it can sometimes be hard to move the pointer into the terminal window (e.g if a lot of motion events were recorded that will let you compete with Xnee on where the mouse pointer shall be located. Beleive me, you'll end up lossing that battle).
