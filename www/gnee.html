	  <h2>Summary</h2>
          Gnee is the GUI frontend to libxnee.
	  <br>
	  <br>
          With gnee you can record and replay user actions
          just as you can with <a href="cnee.html">cnee</a>.
	  Screenshots of gnee can be found <a href="gnee_scr.html">here</a>.
          <br>
          <br>
	  <h2>Background</h2>
	  Allthough Xnee is mostly used by developers (and not 'ordinary
	  users') who are used to use command line programs we soon 
	  saw the need for a GUI program. When giving it some thoughts
	  we realised that such a program and <a href="cnee.html">cnee</a>
	  would actually benefit from each other. As an example of the 
	  benfitial usage of the two you can develop an Xnee project 
	  file using gnee and use this with <a href="cnee.html">cnee</a>
	  when doing automatic regression tests.
	  <br>
	  <br>
          You can also use Gnee to make 
          Xnee project files
          that both xnee and Gnee can use. This makes it easier for
          people not so familiar with the X11 protocol to use
          Xnee (both xnee and Gnee). For more information
          about the project file, read the user manual.
          <br>
	  <h2>Features</h2>
	  gnee comes with all features that is offered by 
	  <a href="libxnee.html">libxnee</a>. The same features are offered 
	  by the command line program program <a href="cnee.html">cnee</a>. 
	  With gnee it is easier (than with <a href="cnee.html">cnee</a>) 
	  to get started with using Xnee as a automatic test tool. 
	  <br>
