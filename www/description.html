	  <h2>Summary</h2>
            Xnee is a suite of programs that can record, replay and
            distribute user actions under the X11 environment. 
            Think of it as a robot that can imitate the job you just 
            did. Xnee can be used to:

         <h2>Description</h2>
           All Xnee applications (<a href="gnee.html">gnee</a> and 
           <a href="xnee.html">xnee</a>) receives X11 protocol data (e g XEvents) from an 
           X server using the libxnee and prints them to a file. This file is used later on 
           when replaying.
           <br>
           <br>
           Events directly generated by the user (e.g KeyPress) can be replayed 
           or faked. 
           Requests, replies, errors and events not directly generated by the 
           user (e.g MapNotify) can be recorded as well. By using these data  
           Xnee can replay with synchronisation. This is not only useful but 
           essential. 
           <br>

	  <h2>Background</h2>
          In order to verify that a program does the job it's supposed to do, 
	  certain tests have to be made. 
          These tests are, IMHO, perhaps the most boring things a programmer 
	  can do. To release the programmer from this burdon Xnee is made. 
          <br>
          Xnee started out as a commad line program. During the development
          phase the main functionality was broken out to a library, called
          <a href="libxnee.html">libxnee</a>. The command line program kept
          the name <a href="xnee.html">xnee</a>. The thought behind making
          the library was to enable the writing of other clients than just 
          a command line. Today there is a GUI program,  
          <a href="gnee.html">gnee</a>
          that uses the library.
          
          <br>
          <br>

          With xnee testcase(s) can be recorded and later on replayed.
	  Xnee can also distribute events (both when recording and replaying) 
	  to other displays.
          <br>
	  Xnee uses X Windows System. For more information about X, check out:

	  <h2>Why Xnee?</h2>
         - Why the name Xnee?
         <br>
         - I wanted to use a recursive acronym, as GNU (``GNU's Not Unix'). 
	 After having read the <a href="http://www.winehq.com" 
	 target=window>Wine</a> 
         documentation, I thought that Xnee is not an Event Emulator would 
	 work fine. Since Xnee is Not an Event Emulator but rather a 
         XEvent generator. Emulation is not part of the game here.... 
	 it just sounds nice!
