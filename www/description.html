	  <h2>Summary</h2>
            Xnee is a suite of programs that can record, replay and
            distribute user actions under the X11 environment. 
            Think of it as a robot that can imitate the job you just 
            did. Xnee can be used to:

         <h2>Description</h2>
           All Xnee applications (<a href="gnee.html">gnee</a> and 
           <a href="cnee.html">cnee</a>) receives X11 protocol data 
	   (e g XEvents) from an 
           X server using the libxnee and prints them to a file. This file 
	   is used later on 
           when replaying.
           <br>
           <br>
           Events directly generated by the user (e.g KeyPress) can be 
	   replayed or faked. 
           Requests, replies, errors and events not directly generated by the 
           user (e.g MapNotify) can be recorded as well. By using these data  
           Xnee applications can replay with synchronisation. This is not 
	   only useful but essential. 
           <br>

	  <h2>Background</h2>
          In order to verify that a program does the job it's supposed to do, 
	  certain tests have to be made. 
          These tests are, IMHO, perhaps the most boring things a programmer 
	  can do. To release the programmer from this burdon Xnee is made. 
          <br>
          Xnee started out as a commad line program. During the development
          phase the main functionality was broken out to a library, called
          <a href="libxnee.html">libxnee</a>. The command line program changed
          its name to <a href="cnee.html">cnee</a>. The thought behind making
          the library was to enable the writing of other clients than just 
          a command line. Today there is a GUI program,  
          <a href="gnee.html">gnee</a>
          that uses the library.
          
          <br>
          <br>

          With Xnee testcase(s) can be recorded and later on replayed.
	  Xnee can also distribute events (both when recording and replaying) 
	  to other displays.
          <br>
	  Xnee uses X Windows System. For more information about X, check out:
