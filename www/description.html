	  <h2>Description</h2>
          In order to verify that a program does the job it's supposed to do, 
	  certain tests have to be made. 
          These tests are, IMHO, perhaps the emost boring things a programmer 
	  can do. To release the 
           programmer, who is hopefully writing 
	   <a href="http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/free-sw.html"  
	   TARGET=newwindow >free software</a> instead,
           from this burdon Xnee is being made. 
         <br>
         <br>
          With xnee the testcase(s) can be recorded and later on replayed.<br> 
	  Xnee can also distribute events (both when recording and replaying) 
	  to other displays.<br>
	  Xnee uses X Windows System. For more information about this 
	  system, check out:

           Xnee receives X11 protocol data (e g XEvents) from an X server and 
	   prints them to a file (or stdout). By recording events such as 
	   MapNotify, the replaying of events can be synchronised. This is not 
	   only useful but essential. We can not replay or regenerate 
	   keyboard-events to a window before it's ready to "receive" events. 
	   By recording events and requests synchronisation can be 
	   implemented.<br>
         <br>
         - Why the name Xnee?
         <br>
         - I wanted to use a recursive acronym, as GNU (``GNU's Not Unix'). 
	 After having read the <a href="http://www.winehq.com" 
	 target=window>Wine</a> 
         documentation, I thought that Xnee is not an Event Emulator would 
	 work fine. Since Xnee is Not an Event Emulator but rather a 
         XEvent generator. Emulation is not part of the game here.... 
	 it just sounds nice!
